### Shell Project
*This project is a simple UNIX command-line interpreter, also known as a shell. The first version of the Unix shell, known as the "Thompson shell" or simply "sh," was written by Ken Thompson in the early days of Unix development. Ken Thompson, along with Dennis Ritchie and others, played a significant role in creating the Unix operating system and its various components, including the shell. The Thompson shell was a fundamental component of the Unix environment and laid the foundation for the development of subsequent Unix shells like the Bourne shell (sh), the C shell (csh), and the Korn shell (ksh).*
